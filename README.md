<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2> 
For this dataset participants were asked to perform one set of 10 repetitions of unilateral dumbbell biceps curl in 5 different styles, the outcome variable is classe.
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<h3>The anticipated out-of-sample error is estimated to be 0.005, or 0.5%. This out-of-sample error is determined by calculating 1 minus the accuracy of predictions made on the cross-validation set. Our test dataset consists of 20 cases. Given an accuracy exceeding 99% on the cross-validation data, we can expect that very few, if any, of the test samples will be misclassified.</p>
